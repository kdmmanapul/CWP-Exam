Important Choices:  
When starting the Project, I was supposed to use NextJS, but instead opt for ReactJS utilizing the Create-React-App together with Material UI as the CSS Library with Styled-Components for cleaner component usage.  


## Libraries and Frameworks Used
ReactJS  
Material UI  
MomentJS  
Styled-Components  
React Router
